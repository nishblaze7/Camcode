# Here is the git repo for calmcode assignments 2. 

1. Ngrok: ngrok
  Created a streamlit app, installed and ran streamit through ngrok.

Tried to add ngrok as a webhook but ran into some issues that I wasn't able to resolve.

2. Index/Search: Lunr
   Installed and ran Lunr through Jupyter Lab. Had to download the dataset as I wasn't able to pull it.
   Lunr proved very useful to index, search, match and display the results. It would be an efficient way to add search functionality on website or web application, helping me find the content I'm looking for quickly and easily.
